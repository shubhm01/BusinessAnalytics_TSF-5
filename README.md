TASK #5

Problem Statement: To Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the sample data of a super store, Exploring Business Analytics.

Approach: Using Python, I read the data of a sample store and used various Machine Learning Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. With all these, I was able to visualise the data and modify it, in order to see the relation between different variables. This helped me gain a deep insight into the business analysis and the extensive use of visual tools such as Python.
